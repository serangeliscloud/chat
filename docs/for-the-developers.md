**Developer's Guide: Understanding the Chat Application Code**

In this guide, we'll delve into the provided code for building a chat application using Node.js. We'll explore both the server-side (`server.js`) and client-side (`client.js`) components, explaining how each piece works and how they interact.

### Server Component (`server.js`)

#### 1. Creating the TCP Server
```javascript
const server = net.createServer(clientSocket => {
    // Server logic goes here
});
```
- This snippet creates a TCP server using Node.js `net` module. It listens for client connections and executes the provided callback function when a new client connects.

#### 2. Handling Client Connections
```javascript
clientSocket.on('data', data => {
    // Logic for handling incoming data from clients
});

clientSocket.on('end', () => {
    // Logic for handling client disconnection
});

clientSocket.on('error', err => {
    // Logic for handling client errors
});
```
- These event listeners handle various events associated with client connections:
  - `'data'`: Handles incoming data from clients, such as messages.
  - `'end'`: Handles client disconnection events.
  - `'error'`: Handles errors that occur during client-server communication.

#### 3. Broadcasting Messages
```javascript
function broadcast(message, sender) {
    // Logic for broadcasting messages to all clients
}
```
- The `broadcast` function sends messages received from one client to all other connected clients, excluding the sender.

#### 4. Handling Initial Messages
```javascript
function handleInitialMessage(message, clientSocket) {
    // Logic for handling initial messages from clients (e.g., authentication)
}
```
- This function processes initial messages sent by clients upon connection. It can perform tasks such as authentication, validating client versions, and broadcasting join messages to other clients.

### Client Component (`client.js`)

#### 1. Creating the TCP Client
```javascript
const client = net.createConnection({ host: HOST, port: PORT }, () => {
    // Client connection logic goes here
});
```
- This snippet creates a TCP client connection to the specified host and port.

#### 2. Handling User Input
```javascript
rl.on('line', input => {
    // Logic for handling user input (sending messages)
});
```
- This event listener captures user input from the command line interface using the `readline` module and sends it to the server as a message.

#### 3. Handling Server Messages
```javascript
client.on('data', data => {
    // Logic for handling incoming messages from the server
});
```
- This event listener receives messages from the server, parses them, and displays them to the user.

#### 4. Graceful Disconnection
```javascript
rl.on('SIGINT', () => {
    // Logic for gracefully disconnecting from the server
});
```
- This event listener captures the Ctrl+C signal and triggers a graceful disconnection from the server, sending a farewell message before closing the connection.

### Conclusion
This developer's guide provides insights into how the provided code implements the server and client components of a chat application in Node.js. By understanding each piece's functionality and how they interact, developers can extend the application's features and customize it according to their requirements.
