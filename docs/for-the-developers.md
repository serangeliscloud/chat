To rewrite the documentation for the chat application code, let's structure it in a more organized and descriptive manner. We'll provide detailed explanations for both the client-side (`client.js`) and server-side (`server.js`) components, highlighting their functionalities and interactions.

### Client Component (`client.js`)

The client-side component of the chat application (`client.js`) is responsible for establishing a connection to the chat server, sending and receiving messages, handling user input, and gracefully disconnecting from the server.

#### Initial Setup and Dependencies
- The client component utilizes the `net`, `readline`, and `fs` modules from Node.js.
- Encryption and decryption functionalities are implemented using the `crypto-js` library.

#### Establishing Connection
- The client connects to the server using the specified host and port (`HOST` and `PORT` constants).

#### User Input Handling
- User input is captured from the command line interface using the `readline` module.
- Empty messages are not allowed to be sent
- Messages starting with '!' are treated as commands, while regular messages are encrypted and sent to the server.

#### Message Encryption and Decryption
- The `encrypt` and `decrypt` functions handle encryption and decryption of messages using a predefined passkey.
- if the predefined key is different across clients an error message will be shown stating that you can't see that message as the encryption key is not the same

#### Event Listeners
- Event listeners are set up to handle data, end, and error events from the server.
- Incoming messages are decrypted and displayed to the user.

#### Graceful Disconnection
- The client handles the Ctrl+C signal to gracefully disconnect from the server, sending a farewell message before closing the connection.

### Server Component (`server.js`)

The server-side component (`server.js`) manages incoming client connections, handles messages, broadcasts messages to all clients, and maintains client information.

#### Initial Setup and Dependencies
- The server component utilizes the `net` module from Node.js.

#### Client Connection Handling
- The server creates a TCP server that listens for incoming client connections.
- Upon connection, each client is assigned a unique ID and added to the list of connected clients.

#### Message Handling
- The server listens for incoming data from clients and processes it accordingly.
- Initial messages are authenticated, and their version is validated against the allowed version.
- Regular messages are broadcasted to all connected clients, while command messages are executed accordingly.

#### Broadcast Functionality
- The `broadcast` function forwards messages from one client to all other connected clients, excluding the sender.

#### Event Listeners
- Event listeners are set up to handle data, end, and error events from clients.
- Disconnected clients are removed from the list of connected clients.

#### Additional Functionality
- The server supports sending server time in response to a specific command (`time`).

### Conclusion
The documentation provides a comprehensive overview of both the client-side and server-side components of the chat application. Developers can use this guide to understand the codebase, extend its features, and customize it according to their requirements.
