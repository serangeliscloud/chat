**Developer's Guide: Understanding the Chat Application Code**

Welcome to the developer's guide for the chat application built using Node.js. This guide will walk you through the codebase of both the server-side (`server.js`) and client-side (`client.js`) components, explaining their functionalities and interactions.

### Server Component (`server.js`)

#### 1. Creating the TCP Server
```javascript
const server = net.createServer(clientSocket => {
    // Server logic goes here
});
```
- This snippet initializes a TCP server using the `net` module in Node.js. It listens for incoming client connections and executes the provided callback function whenever a new client connects.

#### 2. Handling Client Connections
```javascript
clientSocket.on('data', data => {
    // Logic for handling incoming data from clients
});

clientSocket.on('end', () => {
    // Logic for handling client disconnection
});

clientSocket.on('error', err => {
    // Logic for handling client errors
});
```
- These event listeners manage various aspects of client connections:
  - `'data'`: Handles incoming data from clients, such as messages.
  - `'end'`: Manages client disconnection events.
  - `'error'`: Deals with errors occurring during client-server communication.

#### 3. Broadcasting Messages
```javascript
function broadcast(message, sender) {
    // Logic for broadcasting messages to all clients
}
```
- The `broadcast` function forwards messages from one client to all other connected clients, excluding the sender.

#### 4. Handling Initial Messages
```javascript
function handleInitialMessage(message, clientSocket) {
    // Logic for processing initial messages from clients (e.g., authentication)
}
```
- This function processes initial messages sent by clients upon connection. It can perform tasks such as authentication, version validation, and broadcasting join messages to other clients.

### Client Component (`client.js`)

#### 1. Creating the TCP Client
```javascript
const client = net.createConnection({ host: HOST, port: PORT }, () => {
    // Client connection logic goes here
});
```
- This snippet establishes a TCP client connection to the specified host and port.

#### 2. Handling User Input
```javascript
rl.on('line', input => {
    // Logic for handling user input (sending messages)
});
```
- This event listener captures user input from the command line interface using the `readline` module and sends it to the server as a message.

#### 3. Handling Server Messages
```javascript
client.on('data', data => {
    // Logic for handling incoming messages from the server
});
```
- This event listener receives messages from the server, parses them, and displays them to the user.

#### 4. Graceful Disconnection
```javascript
rl.on('SIGINT', () => {
    // Logic for gracefully disconnecting from the server
});
```
- This event listener captures the Ctrl+C signal and initiates a graceful disconnection from the server, sending a farewell message before closing the connection.

### Conclusion
This developer's guide provides an in-depth understanding of the server and client components of the chat application implemented in Node.js. By comprehending each piece's functionality and their interaction, developers can extend the application's features and tailor it to their specific needs.
